Introduction of Trek 
The Annapurna Base Camp (ABC) Trek in Nepal is a truly captivating journey that combines adventure, culture, and breathtaking natural beauty. The trail follows an ancient trade route to Tibet, winding through rhododendron and bamboo forests, terraced farmlands, and charming mountain villages. As the path climbs higher, it leads to the stunning Annapurna Base Camp at 4,130 meters - a spectacular amphitheater surrounded by towering peaks and glaciers. This area, known as the “Annapurna Sanctuary,” is considered the sacred home of the Hindu goddesses Annapurna and Gangapurna.
Our trek also includes a scenic hike to Ghorepani and an early morning climb to Poon Hill, where you can witness the first golden rays of sunrise touching the snow-capped peaks of Dhaulagiri and Annapurna - one of the most unforgettable views in the Himalayas.
Key Highlights of Trek 
• Spectacular Mountain Views: Enjoy breathtaking panoramas of the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri ranges. From close-up views of iconic peaks like Machhapuchhre (Fishtail), Hiunchuli, and Annapurna I to distant giants like Manaslu and Dhaulagiri, the scenery is simply unforgettable.
• Magical Sunrise from Poon Hill: Wake up early for a short climb to Poon Hill (3,210 m) and watch the first golden rays of the sun light up the Himalayan peaks - a moment that many say rivals the views from Annapurna Base Camp itself.
• Cultural Encounters in Mountain Villages: Walk through beautiful Gurung and Magar villages such as Ghandruk, Tadapani, and Chhomrong. Experience their warm hospitality, traditional houses, and a glimpse into local mountain life and culture.
• Diverse and Changing Landscapes: The trek takes you through vibrant rhododendron forests, terraced farmlands, alpine meadows, and deep river valleys before reaching the dramatic glacial basin of the Annapurna Sanctuary.
• Rich Biodiversity in the Annapurna Conservation Area: Discover the natural wonders of the Annapurna Conservation Area, home to an incredible variety of plants and wildlife - including snow leopards, red pandas, Himalayan Monals, and over a hundred species of flowering plants.
• Relax in Natural Hot Springs: On the way back, unwind in the natural hot springs at Jhinu Danda - a perfect way to soothe your tired legs after days of trekking.
• Reaching Annapurna Base Camp: Feel a sense of triumph as you stand at Annapurna Base Camp (4,130 m), surrounded by a spectacular ring of snow-covered peaks - an experience that stays with you forever.

Our Commitment to Sustainability
Environmental Stewardship

Trail and Wildlife Protection: Trekkers are guided to stay on marked trails to prevent erosion and respect wildlife habitats. 
Socio-Cultural Preservation & Community Empowerment
Authentic Local Experiences: Stay in community-run lodges, fostering direct economic benefits and cultural exchange.
Engagement with Local Communities: Trek with certified guides and hire local porters who are fairly compensated and supported with ethical working conditions.
Cultural Sensitivity Training: Pre-trek sessions detail Gurung traditions, sacred mountain reverence, and respectful etiquette, helping travelers foster meaningful and respectful interactions.

Trekkers Responsibilities
Environmental Protection and Waste Management
Bring Reusable Water Solutions: Avoid single-use plastic bottles by carrying water purifiers such as Lifestraw, Sawyer filters, Steripen, or purification tablets. This helps reduce plastic pollution in the fragile Himalayan ecosystem.
Carry Out All Trash: You are responsible for carrying out every piece of your waste, including items like batteries and packaging. Participate in initiatives like the #Carry_Me_Back program, where trekkers help transport trash for proper recycling.
Follow Leave No Trace Principles: Minimize your environmental footprint by sticking to marked trails, avoiding disturbance to wildlife and vegetation, and properly disposing of all waste.
Respect Local Energy Resources: Power in the Annapurna Region is often solar-generated and limited. Use electricity sparingly, bring spare batteries or power banks, and understand that hot showers or Wi-Fi may incur additional charges.
Cultural Respect and Local Engagement
Honor Local Customs and Traditions: Dress modestly and behave respectfully, especially when visiting monasteries or stupas. Walk clockwise around religious sites and observe silence or prayers when appropriate.
Be Respectful and Polite: Engage kindly with guides, porters, lodge owners, and fellow trekkers, recognizing the efforts and hospitality they provide.
Support Local Businesses: Stay at family-run tea houses, purchase authentic handicrafts, and buy local products to directly benefit the communities that welcome you.
Responsible Consumption
Prepare financially: Carry sufficient Nepalese Rupees (NPR), as many remote lodges and vendors do not accept cards. Prices for food, water, and services increase with altitude.
Use Resources Wisely: Conserve water and energy resources on the trail and in lodges, understanding their scarcity and environmental impact.
Trekkers Preparation
• Physical Preparation
To prepare effectively for your trek, start training at least two to three months in advance. Focus on building stamina and endurance through activities like cycling, jogging, swimming, and running. In addition to cardiovascular exercise, incorporate strength training that targets your core, lower body, and upper body. Beneficial exercises include squats, lunges, deadlifts, planks, push-ups, pull-ups, and rows. It’s also important to practice day hikes carrying a backpack weighing 5 to 7 kg, so you get accustomed to walking long distances on varied terrain with uphill and downhill sections. Make sure to break in your hiking boots well before the trip to prevent blisters and discomfort. Overall, the fitter you are, the more enjoyable the trek will be, as it is physically demanding and involves walking 5 to 8 hours daily on rugged, steep paths.


• Health and Acclimatization
   When trekking at high elevations, it's crucial to understand the risks of altitude mountain sickness (AMS), which can affect anyone above 2,400m (8,000ft). Typical symptoms include headaches, nausea, dizziness, insomnia, fatigue, and shortness of breath. More severe conditions like High-Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE) or High-Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE) are medical emergencies and can be fatal. To acclimatize safely, ascend gradually and follow the standard itinerary. Stay well-hydrated by drinking at least 3 liters of water daily and avoiding alcohol and caffeine while ascending. Garlic soup is also suggested for its health benefits.


Ensure you eat enough calories from a balanced diet rich in carbohydrates, proteins, and vitamins, and opt for smaller, frequent meals at higher altitudes. After consulting your doctor, consider taking Diamox, a diuretic that can aid acclimatization. Pay close attention to your body and your guide, taking breaks when needed; if AMS symptoms worsen, immediate descent is essential. Swelling of hands, face, and feet is common at altitude; using compression socks, elevating your feet, and trekking poles can offer relief. Lastly, always consult your doctor if you have a pre-existing medical condition before embarking, and purchase comprehensive travel insurance that covers high-altitude trekking (above 4,000 m) and includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation




• Gear and Packing
When packing for your trek, aim to pack lightly and bring only essentials, as porters typically carry up to 13kg of your main pack. Prioritize good quality, waterproof, and well-fitted trekking boots with ankle support, making sure they’re properly broken in. Essential items include a warm, zero or minus-rated sleeping bag and a down jacket for cold temperatures. Bring a daypack (over 40 liters) for daily necessities and a durable duffel bag for items that porters will carry. Pack warm clothing: several pairs of thermal leggings, quick-dry trekking pants, waterproof pants, moisture-wicking shirts, and a fleece jacket for layering. Essential headwear should include a cap or sun hat, a woolen hat or beanie, a scarf or buff for dust and protection from the cold, and polarized sunglasses.


Don’t forget inner thermal gloves and waterproof outer gloves, along with several pairs of thermal trekking socks, regular socks, and clean undergarments. A headlamp with extra batteries is crucial for dark mornings and nights. Carry water bottles or a hydration bladder (2-3 liters capacity) and water purification tablets or a system, as buying bottled water is costly and environmentally unfriendly. Also, pack a comprehensive first aid kit with necessary medications and blister care, along with sunscreen (SPF 50 or above) and lip balm for sun protection. Bring snacks like energy bars, nuts, and dried fruits for quick energy, and a power bank or spare batteries for electronics, since charging is often expensive at high altitudes. Trekking poles can provide valuable support on uneven trails and help with circulation. If needed, most trekking equipment can be bought or rented in Kathmandu, especially in the Thamel area, making last-minute preparations more convenient.




• Permits and Guides
 For trekking in the Annapurna region, permits are mandatory and primarily include the Annapurna Conservation Area Entry Permit. The Annapurna Area Conservation Permit costs around NPR 3,000 (approximately USD 20) for foreigners. 


Similarly, a TIMS card (Trekkers' Information Management System) has been generally required for most treks in Nepal for safety and information management. Our tour packages include all the trekking permits and entrance fees, so if you are traveling with us, you do not need to worry about this.  


Hiring a guide is highly recommended and is officially mandatory for most trekking routes in Nepal since 2023. Guides enhance safety, offer valuable cultural and trail information, and assist with logistics such as accommodation and food. Although the Nepal Tourism Board enforces guide requirements, the local government recommends but does not mandate guides for the Annapurna region, allowing many solo trekkers. Porters are also highly recommended as they carry heavy bags, easing the trek and supporting the local economy. Many porters eventually become guides themselves, adding value to the community.


• Mental Preparation and Expectations
 Maintaining a positive attitude and mindset is essential to successfully overcoming the challenges encountered during the trek. Be prepared to face physical discomfort, unpredictable weather, and tough terrain along the way. It’s important to embrace the journey itself as much as the destination. Take time to soak in the breathtaking scenery, engage with the local people and their rich culture, and reflect on your own personal growth throughout the experience. Although demanding, the trek is achievable for "normal people" who have good physical fitness and proper preparation, with a high success rate of around 98% for reaching Annapurna Base Camp.


• Other Practical Tips
 Selecting the right trekking season is vital, with spring, autumn, and winter Sep-May) offering the most stable weather and clear skies for the Annapurna region. Carry sufficient amounts of Nepalese Rupees (NPR) in cash, as card payments are rarely accepted, especially at higher elevations, and exchanging your currency in Kathmandu ensures better rates. We help you to find the best exchange rates in Kathmandu and other big cities. 


Respect for local culture and the environment is paramount: dress modestly, adhere to local customs, dispose of waste responsibly, and always walk clockwise around stupas and sacred stones. Stick to designated trekking paths and follow the guidance of your guide to ensure both safety and cultural sensitivity. Meals in teahouses along the trek are generally healthy, with dal bhat (a nutritious lentil soup with rice and vegetables) being a staple and often all-you-can-eat. It's advisable to avoid meat at higher altitudes due to challenges with transportation and refrigeration. Lastly, familiarize yourself with the emergency procedures provided by Green Getaways.

Accommodation on the Annapurna Base Camp (ABC) Trek
During the ABC trek, accommodation primarily consists of teahouses and lodges, with hotel stays provided in Kathmandu and Pokhara at the beginning and end of your journey.
Teahouses and Lodges
Description and Amenities
Teahouses are the most common form of accommodation along the ABC trek route, offering a basic but authentic experience in mountain villages.
Rooms are generally small but clean, typically twin-sharing beds with blankets and mattresses.
Bathrooms can be private or shared. In lower villages like Hile and Ghorepani, facilities often include Western-style toilets and hot running water. At higher altitudes, bathrooms may be more basic, with cold showers or water that must be manually poured. Hot showers, if available, often come at an additional cost.
Common areas in lodges allow trekkers to eat meals, socialize, relax, and enjoy views. Many lodges have wood-burning stoves or heaters to provide warmth.


Food at Teahouses
Full board meals (Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner) are included during the trek.
Traditional Nepali meals such as Dal Bhat (steamed rice, lentil soup, vegetable curry) are highly nutritious and offered with unlimited servings.
Other menu options include momos (dumplings), Thukpa (noodle soup), chapati, porridge, and sandwiches. In larger villages like Ghorepani, you may find pizza, pancakes, and bakery items.
Hot drinks like tea, coffee, or ginger-lemon-honey tea are widely available but may not be included in the package price. Costs generally increase with altitude.
Non-vegetarian dishes are usually available but are less recommended at higher altitudes due to limited refrigeration and transport challenges.


Connectivity and Charging:
Wi-Fi is available in larger villages such as Ghorepani, Tadapani, and Chhomrong, often at an extra cost. The signal may be slow or intermittent.
Charging stations for electronic devices are available at most lodges, but often incur an additional fee. Some use solar power, which can affect availability on cloudy days. Portable power banks are recommended.


Hotels in Kathmandu and Pokhara
Hotels at the start and end of the trek are 5-star category (or similar standard) with daily breakfast included.
Located near city centers, these hotels provide comfort, easy access to restaurants, shops, and trekking gear stores.


Special and Higher-Altitude Accommodation:
Lodges at higher elevations, such as Machhapuchhre Base Camp and ABC, provide basic but clean rooms with stunning mountain views.
Warm meals, blankets, and cozy common areas make your stay comfortable, though amenities are limited due to the remote location.
It is recommended to book or confirm higher-altitude accommodation in advance, especially during peak trekking season (March–May, September–November).


Cultural Aspects:
Eating meals at the teahouse where you stay is customary and respectful.
Interactions with local Gurung and Magar communities provide insight into village life, culture, and traditions.
Teahouse stays offer a unique opportunity for cultural immersion alongside trekking adventure.


Considerations for Trekkers:
Accommodation in the Annapurna region is generally more comfortable than in other trekking regions at similar altitudes, but facilities are basic compared to city hotels.
Trekkers may experience mild altitude sickness, insomnia, or cold temperatures, especially above Ghorepani and at Machhapuchhre Base Camp.
Staying hydrated, eating frequently, and maintaining personal hygiene are crucial for a safe and comfortable trek.
Having an experienced guide is highly recommended for navigation, acclimatization advice, and assistance with lodging and emergencies.
While some lodges are comfortable and well-equipped, remember that most supplies are carried by porters, mules, or yaks, reflecting the remote nature of the Himalayas.

Best Time to Trek Annapurna Base Camp with Ghorepani Poon Hill
The Annapurna Base Camp (ABC) trek with Ghorepani and Poon Hill is one of the most popular trekking routes in Nepal, offering spectacular mountain vistas, lush forests, and cultural encounters with Gurung and Magar villages. For the best experience, we recommend Spring and Autumn as the primary trekking seasons.
Spring (March to May)
Weather and Visibility: Spring brings mild, warm, and dry weather, with daytime temperatures ranging from 15 to 20°C in lower altitudes and 5 to 10°C in higher regions like Ghorepani and ABC. Skies are usually clear, offering excellent visibility of Annapurna, Machhapuchhre, and the surrounding peaks.
Flora: This is the ideal season for flowering rhododendron forests, alpine meadows, and terraced fields. The vibrant colors along the trail make the trek exceptionally scenic, particularly on the Ghorepani–Poon Hill route.
Crowds: Spring is popular among trekkers, so trails and teahouses can be busier. It’s advisable to book accommodation in advance during peak months (April–May).

Autumn (September to November)
Weather and Visibility: Following the monsoon, the air is crisp and clear, providing stable, dry weather. Daytime temperatures range from 12 to 20°C, while nights at higher elevations can drop to 0 to 5°C. Visibility is excellent, making it the best time for panoramic mountain photography.
Flora: While rhododendrons are not in bloom, the terraced fields and forests remain lush and green. The trail offers a dramatic contrast of blue skies and snow-capped peaks.
Crowds: Autumn is slightly less crowded than spring but still popular. Accommodation and lodges are easier to secure with some prior planning.

Other Seasons to Consider
Winter (December to February)
Conditions: Colder temperatures, ranging from 0–10°C in lower regions to –10°C at higher altitudes like ABC. Snowfall may occur above 3,000 meters.
Accessibility: Trails are less crowded, but some higher sections can be slippery due to snow and ice.
Experience: Clear skies often make winter trekking perfect for photography. However, accommodation options may be limited, and some lodges may close for the season.


Monsoon/Summer (June to August)
Conditions: Heavy rainfall, high humidity, and cloudy skies. Daytime temperatures range from 20 to 25°C at lower altitudes. Nights remain cool.
Challenges: Slippery trails, leeches in forested areas, and frequent rain may make trekking more difficult.
Environment: The landscapes are lush and green, and waterfalls are at their peak flow, making it a scenic but challenging season.


Additional Tips
Proper physical preparation is essential. Activities like jogging, cycling, swimming, or hiking on hilly terrain are recommended.
Altitude sickness is less severe on the ABC trek compared to EBC, but gradual acclimatization, hydration, and proper rest are still important.
The trek is non-technical, so anyone in good physical condition can complete it safely with proper guidance.

A Typical Routine Followed by a Trekker During the Annapurna Base Camp Trek
A typical day on the Annapurna Base Camp (ABC) trek is a balance of physical activity, awe-inspiring mountain scenery, and cultural immersion. Trekkers usually wake up early, around 6:00 a.m., to the crisp mountain air. Even in teahouses at higher elevations, mornings can be chilly, so a warm sleeping bag and layered clothing are essential.
Breakfast
Breakfast is usually ordered the night before and may include options like porridge, eggs, pancakes, oatmeal, or musli with fruit and hot milk. Hot drinks, such as tea, coffee, or ginger-lemon-honey tea, are a must to start the day energized. Breakfast is included in the trekking package.
Trekking
Hiking typically starts between 7:00 and 7:30 a.m. Trekkers walk 4–7 hours daily, covering distances of 8–15 kilometers depending on the day’s itinerary. The terrain varies from gentle inclines and terraced fields in lower villages like Hile and Ghorepani to steeper, rocky, and sometimes slippery paths above Tadapani and Chhomrong. Along the way, trekkers cross suspension bridges over rivers such as the Modi Khola and traverse rhododendron, oak, and pine forests, enjoying the sounds of flowing streams and birdsong.
Arrival at Destination
Upon reaching the day’s stop, trekkers check into local lodges or teahouses. These accommodations are typically basic but cozy, offering twin-sharing rooms with mattresses, blankets, and sometimes attached bathrooms. At higher elevations, bathrooms may be shared, and hot showers are limited or may require a small additional fee. Wi-Fi and charging facilities may be available in larger villages, but are not always reliable.
Evening
 Evenings are spent in communal dining areas, often near a wood-burning stove, providing warmth and a space to relax. Trekkers share meals, swap stories, play cards, and socialize with fellow adventurers and local hosts. Guides and porters assist throughout the day, helping with trail navigation, carrying gear, monitoring health, and arranging meals and lodging.
End of Day
After a hearty dinner, trekkers usually retire early to rest and prepare for the next day’s adventure. Despite the physical demands, the ABC trek offers a deeply rewarding experience, from sunrise at Poon Hill to panoramic views at Machhapuchhre Base Camp and ABC, leaving trekkers with lasting memories, cultural insights, and a profound sense of achievement.
Types and Cost of Permits for the Annapurna Base Camp Trek with Ghorepani Poonhill 
For the Annapurna Base Camp (ABC) trek with Ghorepni Poonhill, you will generally need two primary permits:
1. Annapurna Conservation Area Permit (ACAP)
Purpose: This permit allows entry into the Annapurna Conservation Area, a protected region with rich biodiversity and stunning landscapes.
Cost: NPR 3,000 per foreigner.
Where to Obtain: The permit can be obtained in Kathmandu, Pokhara, or at the entry point in Birethanti/Nayapul. You will need a passport copy and two passport-sized photographs.
2. TIMS Card (Trekkers’ Information Management System Card)
Purpose: Designed to track trekkers’ safety and trekking activities in Nepal.
Cost: NPR 2,000.
Where to Obtain: Issued at the Nepal Tourism Board in Kathmandu or in Pokhara before starting the trek.
Note: Green Getaways includes all necessary permits and TIMS cards in the package, so trekkers booking through us do not need to worry about paperwork.


Guide Requirement and Solo Trekking Policies
The ABC trek can be completed without a guide, but hiring an experienced trekking guide is strongly recommended for safety, navigation, and support.
Porters are available (usually one porter per two trekkers) to help carry luggage, making the trek more comfortable.


Acclimatization During the ABC Trek
Although the ABC trek is lower in altitude than EBC, proper acclimatization is still important to avoid altitude sickness. The trek passes altitudes of up to 4,130 meters (ABC).
Acclimatization in the ABC Itinerary
Ghorepani/Poon Hill: A key acclimatization opportunity is the early morning hike to Poon Hill (3,210m) for sunrise views of Annapurna and Dhaulagiri. Walking to slightly higher points and returning helps your body adjust.


Machhapuchhre Base Camp / Annapurna Base Camp: Gradual ascent through Chhomrong, Dovan, and Machhapuchhre Base Camp ensures proper acclimatization before reaching ABC.


Prevention and Management of Altitude-Related Issues
Several measures can help reduce the risk of Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) and ensure a safe trek:
1. Gradual Ascent and Pacing
Ascend slowly and walk at your own pace.
Daily altitude gains are limited in the itinerary to facilitate acclimatization.


2. Hydration
Drink at least 2–3 liters of water per day.
Avoid alcohol and excessive caffeine.
Electrolytes and boiled water are recommended.


3. Rest and Sleep
Proper rest is crucial. Avoid long naps during the day on acclimatization days to ensure good night's sleep.
4. Nutrition
Eat small, frequent meals.
Traditional Dal Bhat (rice, lentils, vegetables) is highly recommended for energy.
Carry high-energy snacks like nuts, chocolate, or energy bars.


5. Medication
Diamox (acetazolamide) can help with mild altitude sickness, but consult a doctor before use.


6. Guide Support
A licensed guide can monitor your health, advise on acclimatization, and assist with emergencies.


Other Health Considerations
Cold and Sun Exposure: Temperatures can drop significantly at ABC and Machhapuchhre Base Camp. Wear layers and use sunscreen and lip balm.
Stomach Issues: Changes in diet and hygiene can cause mild digestive issues. Eat frequent small meals and drink safe water.
Fatigue: Daily hikes of 4–7 hours may be physically demanding. Stamina training before the trek is recommended.
Swelling: Hands, face, or feet may swell at higher altitudes; trekking poles and proper footwear can help.


Physical Preparation
Though the ABC trek is non-technical, it is physically demanding.
Training is recommended, including hiking, jogging, cycling, swimming, and strength exercises.
Being physically fit improves enjoyment and reduces the risk of injury or fatigue.

General Safety and Preparation Tips
Travel Insurance
Travel insurance is highly recommended and should cover high-altitude trekking, medical costs, and helicopter evacuation up to at least 4,200 meters, as the ABC trek reaches 4,130m at Annapurna Base Camp.
Packing Wisely
Pack light but bring essentials: warm clothing for layering, good-quality hiking boots (broken in), a sleeping bag rated for cold weather, trekking poles, a headlamp, and a personal first aid kit.
Local Currency and Payments
Nepalese Rupees are used throughout the trek. Carry sufficient cash, as card payments are mostly limited to Pokhara and some larger villages along the trail (e.g., Ghorepani, Chhomrong). Prices for food, drinks, and charging devices increase with altitude.
Respect Local Culture and Environment
Dress modestly, be mindful of local customs, dispose of waste responsibly, and follow Leave No Trace principles. Trekking through villages is also an opportunity to interact respectfully with locals and observe traditional lifestyles.
Flexibility
Weather conditions can affect transportation, especially the flight from Kathmandu to Pokhara or road travel to Nayapul/Birethanti. Building buffer days into your itinerary is recommended.
Communication
Mobile network coverage and Wi-Fi are available in some villages like Pokhara, Ghorepani, and Chhomrong, but connections are often slow or unreliable at higher altitudes. Carry a power bank for devices.
Overall Experience
The ABC trek is a transformative adventure, offering spectacular views of the Annapurna range, cultural immersion in Gurung and Magar villages, and a deep sense of personal accomplishment for those prepared and respectful of the mountains.
Culture and Community During the Trek
The Annapurna region offers rich cultural experiences, closely intertwined with the natural beauty and trekking environment.
Gurung and Magar Communities
The trek passes through villages like Ghandruk, Chhomrong, and Landruk, where Gurung and Magar communities maintain traditional lifestyles.
Local hospitality is warm, and you will have opportunities to interact with villagers, learn about daily routines, and visit schools, monasteries, or community centers.
Tea houses are usually run by local families, offering twin-sharing rooms and communal dining areas where trekkers eat, socialize, and connect with locals.


Spirituality and Traditions
Small chortens, prayer flags, and mani stones are seen along the trail. Circumnavigating them clockwise and spinning prayer wheels is considered auspicious.
Monasteries, such as Ghandruk Monastery, offer insight into local Buddhist practices, rituals, and festivals.
Local villagers celebrate traditional festivals and ceremonies, providing trekkers with a glimpse of the cultural richness of the Annapurna region.


Daily Life and Economy
Porters, mules, and yaks transport supplies along the trekking route, as there are no roads connecting the higher villages.
Livelihoods are supported by tourism, agriculture, and animal husbandry. Yaks provide milk, meat, fur, and transport, while villagers cultivate terraces of rice, millet, and vegetables.
Tea houses act as cultural hubs where trekkers can observe daily life, share meals, and experience local customs firsthand.


Historical and Commemorative Aspects
Villages like Ghandruk have preserved traditional stone and mud houses, reflecting centuries of architectural heritage.
The trail itself has historical significance, having been a traditional trade route for salt and grains between the lowlands and the high Himalayas.
Bridges, stupas, and trails provide a glimpse into local engineering ingenuity and cultural resilience in the mountainous environment.


Tip: Respectful interaction, patience, and curiosity enhance the trekking experience and leave a positive impact on the communities you visit.

Currency Exchange Location
You can exchange money in Pokhara, where banks and exchange counters are widely available. Some larger villages along the trekking route, such as Ghandruk or Nayapul, may have limited exchange facilities, but rates are generally low.
Recommended: Exchange the majority of your currency in Kathmandu before heading to the mountains. Thamel and the airport offer reliable services with good rates.
Preferred Payment Method: Cash is King
Always carry cash during the trek, as card payments are rarely accepted beyond Pokhara.
Most tea houses, lodges, and shops along the ABC trek route prefer Nepalese Rupees (NPR).
ATMs are available in Pokhara only; higher-altitude villages do not have ATM facilities.


Typical Trek Costs & Additional Expenses
While Green Getaways includes permits, accommodation, and three meals per day along the trek, there are some additional costs you may incur:
Hot showers: Available at many tea houses, typically for 200–400 NPR per shower. Solar-heated water may be limited, especially on cloudy days.
Device charging: Most lodges charge 100–200 NPR for charging phones or cameras. Bring a power bank to avoid extra costs.
Wi-Fi/Internet: Available in villages like Ghorepani, Chhomrong, and Landruk at 200–500 NPR per hour. Speeds may be slow.
Drinks and beverages: Tea, coffee, hot chocolate, and mineral water are generally not included in the trekking package. A cup of tea can cost 200-400 NPR, increasing with altitude.
Snacks and extra food: Energy bars, dried fruits, or extra snacks may be needed for long trekking days.
Souvenirs and personal expenses: Laundry, phone calls, or other personal needs are additional.


How Much Cash to Carry
Approximately $1200–250 USD per person is sufficient for extra expenses such as hot showers, drinks, snacks, and Wi-Fi. Costs increase gradually with altitude due to logistical challenges; supplies are carried by porters, mules, or yaks.

It involves long walking days on rugged terrain, including significant ascents and descents with numerous stone steps. However, it does not involve technical mountaineering skills and is accessible to individuals with basic physical fitness.

Q: Do I need prior trekking experience?
