Introduction of Trek
We invite you to discover the breathtaking and culturally rich adventure of the Manaslu and Tsum Valley Trek. Nestled around Mount Manaslu, the world’s eighth-highest mountain (8,163m / 26,781ft), this trek offers a unique, off-the-beaten-path journey into Nepal's wild Himalayas.
The Manaslu Circuit Trek, known for its serenity and rugged beauty, is a less crowded alternative to more popular routes like Everest Base Camp and Annapurna Circuit. It traverses diverse landscapes, from lush subtropical forests and terraced fields to high alpine terrain, culminating in the challenging Larkya La Pass (5,106m to 5,167m / 16,751ft to 16,952ft). Along the way, trekkers immerse themselves in Tibetan-influenced culture, exploring ancient Buddhist monasteries, mani walls, and experiencing the unique traditions of local Gurung and Tibetan communities.
An optional detour, the Tsum Valley Trek, extends this adventure into a sacred Himalayan journey, known for its profound spiritual culture and ancient monasteries, remaining largely untouched by modern development. Combined, these treks can range from 19 to 22 days or more, offering an even deeper immersion into the region's natural and cultural heritage.

Due to its remote location bordering Tibet, the Manaslu region is a restricted area, requiring special permits and a mandatory licensed guide for groups of at least two trekkers. At Green Getaways, we specialize in sustainable and eco-friendly trekking practices, emphasizing low environmental impact, supporting local communities through initiatives like the Manaslu Conservation Area Project, and preserving the region's delicate balance of nature and culture. This challenging yet immensely rewarding trek is perfect for those seeking solitude, authentic cultural experiences, and unparalleled dramatic alpine beauty.



Key Highlights of Trek
• Circumnavigation of Mount Manaslu & Tsum Valley: Embark on a journey that encircles Mount Manaslu (8,163m/26,781ft), the world's eighth-highest peak, and extends into the sacred Tsum Valley, a unique region renowned for its deep spiritual culture.


• Conquering High-Altitude Passes: Experience the challenge and reward of traversing the Larkya La Pass (ranging from 5,106m/16,751ft to 5,167m/16,952ft), the highest point of the Manaslu Circuit. This pass offers breathtaking panoramic views of majestic peaks such as Himlung Himal, Cheo Himal, Kang Guru, Annapurna II, and Ganesh Himal.


• Deep Cultural Immersion: Delve into the rich Tibetan-Buddhist culture prevalent in remote villages like Lho, Samagaon, and Samdo, and particularly within the Tsum Valley, which feels like its own world. You'll encounter ancient monasteries such as Pungyen Gompa and Mu Gompa, alongside mani walls, chortens, and vibrant prayer flags that define the spiritual landscape.


• Untouched Wilderness & Diverse Ecosystems: Trek along less-crowded, off-the-beaten trails, providing a sense of solitude and a genuine connection with nature. The journey showcases a dramatic range of landscapes, from lush subtropical forests bursting with rhododendrons, pines, and oaks, to high alpine pastures and glacial valleys. The Manaslu Conservation Area is home to diverse flora and fauna, offering opportunities to spot rare wildlife including snow leopards, red pandas, Himalayan tahr, and blue sheep.
• Authentic Village Experiences: Engage with friendly local communities and witness their traditional lifestyles, which include agriculture and yak herding. Villages like Jagat, Philim, Lho, Samagaon, and Samdo offer unique cultural insights and warm hospitality.


• Strategic Acclimatization Plan: Our itineraries include essential acclimatization days at key locations like Samagaon (3,530m/11,581ft) and Samdo (3,875m/12,713ft). These days often feature optional side hikes to sites such as Manaslu Base Camp, Pungyen Gompa, or Birendra Tal, employing a "hike high, sleep low" strategy vital for safe adaptation to high altitudes and ensuring a successful and comfortable trek.


• Exclusive Restricted Area Access: The Manaslu and Tsum Valley regions are designated as restricted areas by the Nepali government. This ensures a more exclusive adventure, as it mandates a licensed guide and a minimum of two trekkers to obtain the necessary permits (Manaslu Restricted Area Permit, Tsum Valley Restricted Area Permit, Manaslu Conservation Area Permit, and Annapurna Conservation Area Permit).


• Commitment to Responsible Tourism: Our treks are conducted with a strong focus on sustainable and eco-friendly practices, operating within the Manaslu Conservation Area Project (MCAP). This approach supports waste management, minimizes environmental impact, and contributes to the preservation of the region's unique ecological and cultural heritage.

Our Commitment to Sustainability 
At Green Getaways, we believe that the breathtaking beauty of the Himalayas, particularly the pristine Manaslu and Tsum Valley regions, comes with a profound responsibility to protect and preserve them for generations to come. Our "Commitment to Sustainability" is not just a policy; it's the heart of every trekking adventure we craft for you, designed to create an unforgettable experience while leaving a positive and lasting impact.
The Manaslu and Tsum Valley regions are often described as Nepal's "hidden treasures," offering off-the-beaten-path experiences far from the crowds of more commercialized treks. These areas are classified as restricted zones due to their remote location, fragile ecosystems, and unique Tibetan Buddhist cultures. The communities here live peacefully amidst stunning landscapes, maintaining centuries-old traditions evident in their ancient monasteries, mani walls, and vibrant daily life. However, with increasing visitor numbers, these delicate environments face challenges like waste management, deforestation, and soil erosion.
Here's how Green Getaways champions sustainable and responsible tourism, fostering trust and ensuring your adventure contributes to the well-being of these sacred lands:

• Our Environmental Pledge: Leaving No Trace We are dedicated to Zero Waste Trekking, focusing on minimizing our environmental footprint. This means actively reducing plastic waste by encouraging the use of reusable water bottles, utensils, and food containers. We advise against buying bottled mineral water and will provide water purification solutions or access to boiled water at teahouses. Our commitment extends to carrying out all non-biodegradable waste, ensuring that delicate ecosystems are not burdened by litter. We strictly adhere to marked trekking trails to prevent soil erosion and protect the diverse flora and fauna, respecting wildlife by maintaining a safe distance and never disturbing natural habitats. We also prioritize eco-friendly accommodations that utilize clean energy sources like solar power where available.

• Our Community & Cultural Promise: Authentic Immersion Your journey with Green Getaways is a profound cultural exchange. We exclusively hire licensed local guides and porters from the Manaslu region, directly supporting local livelihoods and empowering communities. Our guides, often native to these mountains, offer invaluable insights into local customs, history, and the unique blend of Indo-Aryan and Tibetan-Burmese cultures along the trail. We encourage staying in family-run teahouses and purchasing locally-made crafts and products, ensuring that the economic benefits of your visit directly uplift the villages you pass through. We educate our trekkers on respecting local traditions, such as walking clockwise around mani walls and chortens, asking permission before taking photographs, and dressing modestly as a sign of respect for local customs. Learning basic Nepali greetings like "Namaste" (Hello) and "Dhanyawad" (Thank You) fosters genuine connections with the warm and hospitable locals.
• Our Commitment to Ethical Operations: 
Transparency and Safety As the Manaslu region is a restricted area, obtaining permits is a multi-step process. Green Getaways handles all necessary permits—Manaslu Restricted Area Permit (RAP), Manaslu Conservation Area Permit (MCAP), and Annapurna Conservation Area Permit (ACAP)—on your behalf, ensuring full compliance with Nepalese government regulations. These permit fees are crucial; they contribute directly to local development, conservation efforts, and the construction of schools and health facilities in remote areas. We uphold the mandatory requirement of trekking with a licensed guide and ensure your group meets the minimum size requirement.

• Your safety and well-being are paramount. Our itineraries are carefully designed with dedicated acclimatization days in villages like Samagaun and Samdo, following the "climb high, sleep low" principle to minimize the risk of altitude sickness. All our guides are experienced and trained in first aid and high-altitude emergency response, ensuring you are in capable hands throughout your journey. We also ethically treat our porters and staff, ensuring fair wages, proper equipment, insurance, and medical care, recognizing them as the backbone of our expeditions.
At Green Getaways, we are passionate about sharing the magic of the Manaslu and Tsum Valley with you, not just as a destination, but as a vibrant, living ecosystem and culture that deserves our utmost respect. By choosing us, you embark on an adventure that is not only thrilling and deeply personal but also a conscious step towards preserving the unparalleled beauty and rich heritage of the Himalayas.

Trekkers Responsibilities

    ◦ Stay strictly on marked trails to prevent soil erosion and damage to fragile vegetation.
    ◦ Avoid picking plants and flowers, and maintain a safe distance from wild animals.

    ◦ Carry your original passport with a valid Nepali visa as it is required for permit issuance and at numerous army and government checkposts along the trail.

• Prioritize Safety and Well-being: Your health and safety are paramount in these remote, high-altitude environments.
    ◦ Listen carefully to your guide's advice on trail conditions, acclimatization strategies, and emergency procedures. Our guides are trained in first aid and mountain rescue.

    ◦ Stay well-hydrated throughout the trek and avoid alcohol and smoking at high altitudes.
    ◦ Report any symptoms of altitude sickness (headache, nausea, dizziness) immediately to your guide, even if mild.
    ◦ Ensure you have comprehensive travel insurance that covers high-altitude trekking, medical expenses, and helicopter rescue/evacuation up to 6,000 meters.

By upholding these responsibilities, you help Green Getaways preserve the unique beauty and culture of the Manaslu and Tsum Valley regions, ensuring a respectful, safe, and truly unforgettable adventure for yourself and future generations.



Trekkers Preparation 
Physical Preparation
The Manaslu and Tsum Valley trek is considered moderate to challenging or strenuous, requiring a good level of fitness. While prior high-altitude experience is beneficial, it's certainly within reach for fit first-time trekkers with the right preparation. Our itineraries are designed to accommodate various age groups, with trekkers ranging from 10 to 70 years old successfully completing similar journeys.
Here are our top tips for physical readiness:
• Cardiovascular Training: Engage in activities like running or cycling to build stamina for long daily hikes.
• Strength Training: Focus on leg strength (lunges, squats) and core exercises (planks) to prepare for uphill and downhill sections on varied terrain.
• Stair Climbing: This effectively simulates the steep ascents and descents you'll encounter, strengthening your knees.
• Hiking with a Backpack: Practice hiking with a loaded backpack (8-10 kg) to get accustomed to carrying weight and navigating uneven trails.
• Acclimatization: Our itineraries incorporate dedicated acclimatization days, typically in Samagaun (3,530m) and Samdo (3,875m). These days often include "climb high, sleep low" hikes, such as to Manaslu Base Camp (4,800m) or Pungyen Gompa, which are vital for your body to adjust to higher altitudes and reduce the risk of altitude sickness.
• Hydration: Develop good hydration habits by drinking plenty of water regularly to prevent altitude-related issues.

Mental Preparation
Mental resilience is as crucial as physical fitness for the Manaslu Circuit Trek.
• Set Realistic Expectations: Be prepared for basic lodge accommodations, cold nights, and limited access to facilities like Wi-Fi or mobile reception at higher altitudes.
• Embrace Discomfort: View challenges as part of the unique experience. Focus on the stunning mountain views, authentic cultural interactions, and the solitude of the Himalayas.
• Flexibility and Patience: The weather in the mountains can be unpredictable, leading to rapid changes in trail conditions or occasional delays. Being flexible with the itinerary and patient with unforeseen circumstances will significantly enhance your experience.
• Connect with Your Guide: Our experienced local guides are not just navigators; they are storytellers and cultural ambassadors. Engaging with them will provide valuable insights and motivation throughout your journey.

Logistical Preparation
Green Getaways handles many logistical aspects, but understanding these points will ensure a smooth journey.
• Permits: The Manaslu region is a restricted area, and the Tsum Valley is also restricted, requiring special permits. For both the Manaslu and Tsum Valley treks, you will need:
    ◦ Manaslu Restricted Area Permit (RAP).
    ◦ Manaslu Conservation Area Permit (MCAP).
    ◦ Annapurna Conservation Area Permit (ACAP), as the trek route eventually joins the Annapurna Circuit.
    ◦ If including Tsum Valley, you will also need a Tsum Valley Restricted Area Permit. Green Getaways will arrange all necessary permits on your behalf. You will need to provide a copy of your passport, Nepalese visa, and two passport-sized photos. Important Note: Trekking in these restricted areas requires a minimum of two trekkers (excluding the guide and porters) and must be accompanied by a licensed local guide from a registered trekking agency. Solo trekking is not permitted.

• Guides and Porters:
    ◦ Mandatory Guide: A licensed, English-speaking guide is compulsory for the Manaslu and Tsum Valley trek. Our guides are from the local Manaslu region, offering unmatched insight into the terrain, culture, and traditions. They are also trained in first aid and emergency response.
    ◦ Porters: While optional, hiring a porter is highly recommended to make your trek more enjoyable and less strenuous. Porters typically carry up to 20 kg for two trekkers. Green Getaways is committed to the ethical treatment of our porters, ensuring fair wages, insurance, proper gear, and medical care.

• Accommodation: The Manaslu and Tsum Valley trek is primarily a teahouse trek.
    ◦ Rooms: Accommodations are generally basic, family-run lodges offering twin-bed rooms with thin mattresses, pillows, and blankets.
    ◦ Facilities: Toilets are usually shared, with a mix of Western and squat styles, and may be located outside the main building. Heating is typically only available in the communal dining areas, often with a yak-dung or wood stove. Hot showers and Wi-Fi are often limited or unavailable at higher altitudes, and usually come with an extra charge.
    ◦ Sleeping Bag: We highly recommend bringing a good quality sleeping bag (rated -10°C to -20°C) for additional warmth, as teahouse blankets alone may not suffice in colder regions, especially at Dharmasala.
    ◦ Pre-booking: Especially during peak seasons (spring and autumn), pre-booking accommodations is advisable due to limited availability in some remote villages. Green Getaways will handle all accommodation arrangements to ensure you have the best available options.
• Food: You can expect a variety of Western and Nepali food, with vegetarian and vegan options. However, choices become more limited at higher altitudes. We encourage you to try local, hygienic meals and carry energy bars or snacks for additional sustenance during long trekking days.
• Packing List: Pack light but smart, focusing on layers for fluctuating temperatures and weather conditions. Key items include:
    ◦ Clothing: Thermal innerwear, fleece, down jacket, waterproof/windproof shell jacket, trekking pants, warm hat, warm gloves, wool socks.
    ◦ Footwear: Lightweight, waterproof trekking boots with good ankle support.
    ◦ Gear: Sleeping bag (-10°C to -20°C), refillable water bottles (2L capacity), water purification tablets/filter, headlamp with extra batteries, trekking poles, sunglasses (UV protection), sunscreen (SPF 50+), lip balm, small first-aid kit.
    ◦ Personal Documents: Valid passport, photocopies of passport, extra passport-sized photos, airline tickets, visa form, proof of travel insurance, and some cash.
    ◦ Daypack: Carry a smaller daypack for daily essentials like water, snacks, camera, rain gear, and extra layers.

• Travel Insurance: Comprehensive travel insurance is mandatory. It must cover high-altitude trekking up to 6,000 meters, emergency medical expenses, and helicopter rescue/evacuation. Please provide a copy of your policy to Green Getaways before your trek.

• Currency: You will need Nepalese Rupees (NPR) for personal expenses like hot showers, Wi-Fi, battery charging, snacks, and souvenirs. ATMs are extremely limited on the trail, so it's advisable to withdraw sufficient cash in Kathmandu before starting your trek.

• Transportation: The trek typically starts with a drive from Kathmandu to Soti Khola (approximately 6-8 hours by private vehicle, longer by public bus). After crossing Larkya La Pass and descending, you'll drive from Dharapani to Besisahar (around 6 hours by local jeep), and then from Besisahar back to Kathmandu or Pokhara (5-7 hours by jeep/bus). Green Getaways will arrange all your transfers, with options for public or private transport.
Green Getaways' Responsible Trekking Focus
At Green Getaways, we are committed to sustainable tourism and invite you to join us in protecting the pristine beauty and unique culture of the Manaslu and Tsum Valley regions.

• Reduce Waste: We advocate for "zero waste trekking" by encouraging reusable water bottles and purification methods (tablets, filters, boiled water from teahouses) to minimize plastic waste. Please pack out all non-biodegradable waste.

• Respect Local Culture: Immerse yourself respectfully in the Tibetan-influenced communities. Always ask permission before taking photos of people or religious sites and dress modestly. Support the local economy by purchasing local crafts and staying in community-run teahouses.

• Leave No Trace: Stay on marked trails to protect fragile ecosystems and wildlife. Avoid picking plants or disturbing animals.

Important Informations for Your Trekking Decision 

 Accommodation
During your Manaslu Circuit Trek, accommodation is primarily in teahouses or lodges. These are typically basic, family-run establishments that offer essential amenities in a remote mountain setting.
• Room Facilities: You can expect basic rooms with two single beds, thin mattresses, pillows, and blankets. Heating is generally not available in bedrooms, but dining areas are usually heated, often by a yak-dung or wood stove, providing a cozy communal space.
• Bathroom Facilities: Toilets and bathrooms are typically shared and may be located outside the main building. Some lodges at lower altitudes or popular stops like Namrung might offer attached bathrooms and hot showers, though these are rarer at higher elevations.
• Limited Facilities: Due to the region's remoteness, the number of lodges and facilities declines as you trek higher. Accommodation availability can be unpredictable during peak seasons, making advance arrangements crucial.
• Camping: Historically a camping route, the Manaslu Circuit still offers camping options for those seeking a true wilderness adventure, although this typically comes with a higher price tag due to the need for extensive gear and a dedicated support crew.
• Popular Stops: Key accommodation stops include Machhakhola, Jagat, Deng, Namrung, Lho, Samagaun, Samdo, Dharmasala, and Bhimthang.

 Food
The Manaslu Circuit Trek offers a menu focused on local cuisine, providing wholesome and energizing meals.
• Typical Offerings: You'll find staple Nepali dishes like dal bhat (lentil soup and rice), along with Tibetan bread, tsampa (barley porridge), momos, pasta, soups, and seasonal vegetables. Eggs and toast are often available for breakfast and dinner.
• Variety and Freshness: Food variety may diminish with altitude as fresh supplies become scarce in higher villages. It is often recommended to be vegetarian while trekking uphill to ensure freshness.
• Drinks: Tea, coffee, hot chocolate, and bottled soft drinks are usually available, though bottled water is discouraged for environmental reasons.
• Water: Water is available from local sources, but purification is essential. We provide water purification tablets for safe drinking.

 Best Time to Trek
The best time to do the Manaslu Circuit Trek is during Autumn and Spring. Each season offers a distinct experience:
• Autumn (September to November): This is the peak trekking season, offering stable weather, clear skies, and outstanding mountain views, especially in October. Trails are dry, and temperatures are moderate. While it can be busy, it's generally less crowded than other popular trails.
• Spring (March to May): Spring brings mild temperatures (10-20°C during the day) and clear morning views. The lower altitudes are vibrant with rhododendron and wildflower blooms, making the landscapes incredibly beautiful.
• Winter (December to February): This season is quiet with fewer trekkers. Skies are clear, but temperatures drop significantly (below -20°C at night at higher altitudes), and heavy snowfall can make Larkya La Pass challenging or impassable. Special gear like crampons and sub-zero sleeping bags are essential.
• Summer/Monsoon (June to August): This is generally not a recommended time due to heavy rainfall, wet and slippery paths, and potential landslides. Cloud cover often obscures mountain views. It's suitable only for experienced trekkers seeking solitude and lush greenery.

Typical Routine During the Trek
A typical day on the Manaslu Circuit Trek with Green Getaways is designed to balance adventure with comfort and acclimatization.
• Morning: Days start early with a hot cup of tea/coffee around 6:00 AM. After a wholesome breakfast, trekking usually begins between 7:00 AM and 8:00 AM.
• Mid-day: You will trek for about 3 to 4 hours before stopping for lunch, followed by an hour of rest. Packed lunches may be provided on certain days depending on the route.
• Afternoon: The afternoon walk is generally shorter. Once you reach the day's destination, you'll have time to explore the village or relax.
• Evening: Evenings are for unwinding and socializing. Dinner is served around 7:00 PM at the teahouse. Your guide will then brief you on the next day's route, highlights, and address any questions. It's customary to order your breakfast the night before.
• Daily Distance: Trekkers generally hike around 10-15 km or 5-6 hours per day.

Types and Cost of Permits During the Trek
The Manaslu Circuit Trek is located in a restricted area bordering Tibet, thus requiring several special permits. Green Getaways will handle all permit arrangements for a hassle-free experience.
• Manaslu Restricted Area Permit (RAP): This is the most significant permit due to the region's restricted status.
    ◦ Cost (September to November - peak season): USD 100 per person for the first 7 days, then an additional USD 15 per day.
    ◦ Cost (December to August - off-peak season): USD 75 per person for the first 7 days, then an additional USD 10 per day.
• Manaslu Conservation Area Permit (MCAP): Required to enter the Manaslu Conservation Area, which protects the region's unique ecosystem and cultural heritage.
    ◦ Cost: NPR 3,000 (approximately USD 20-30) for foreign nationals, regardless of duration.
• Annapurna Conservation Area Permit (ACAP): Needed because the trek's latter part overlaps with the Annapurna Conservation Area.
    ◦ Cost: NPR 2,000 (approximately USD 20-30) for foreign nationals.
• Chumnubri Rural Municipality Permit: A local fee of USD 10 or NPR 1000 per person started from September 6, 2024, to enter this area.
Total estimated permit cost for a 14-day trek can range from USD 100-150 depending on the season and specific itinerary.

 Guide Requirement and Solo Trekking Policies
For your safety and to preserve the unique culture of the Manaslu region, the Nepalese government has strict rules:
• Mandatory Guide: It is mandatory to trek with a licensed guide. Your Green Getaways guide is highly experienced, knowledgeable about the terrain, local culture, and trained in first aid and emergency responses.
• No Solo Trekking: Solo individual trekkers are forbidden to enter the Manaslu region. You must be in a group of at least two trekkers (excluding your guide and porter) to obtain the special permit.
• Registered Agency: Permits can only be obtained through a registered trekking agency in Nepal. Green Getaways will manage all official work to secure your permits.
• Checkpoints: There are army checkpoints along the trail where all required permits and provisions must be fulfilled to cross.

 Acclimatization
Acclimatization is a critical part of any high-altitude trek and is essential for safety and success on the Manaslu Circuit Trek.
• Altitude Gain: The trek ascends dramatically from Machha Khola (800-930m / 2,625-3,051ft) to Larkya La Pass (5,106-5,160m / 16,751-16,929ft). This significant elevation gain requires careful acclimatization.
• Acclimatization Days: Our itineraries include dedicated acclimatization days at strategic locations like Samagaun (3,530m) and sometimes Samdo (3,875m). These days often involve "hike high, sleep low" excursions, such as day trips to Manaslu Base Camp (4,400-4,800m) or Pungyen Gompa.
• Prevention of Altitude Sickness: Trekking slowly, staying hydrated, avoiding alcohol and smoking, and listening to your body are crucial for preventing Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS). Our guides are trained to recognize and respond to altitude-related issues.
• Fitness: While the trek is achievable for fit first-time trekkers, a reasonable level of fitness and prior experience at altitudes above 4,000 meters is highly recommended.

Culture and Community During the Trek

6. How fit do I need to be, and what physical preparation is recommended?
The Manaslu Circuit Trek is a moderately to highly challenging high-altitude trek requiring a moderate to good level of physical fitness. You should be prepared for long days of walking (5-9 hours daily) over varied and rugged terrain with significant ascents and descents.
We recommend starting training at least one to two months prior to your trek. Your preparation should include:
• Cardiovascular exercises (running, swimming, cycling) to build stamina and lung capacity.
• Strength training (lunges, squats) focusing on legs and core.
• Regular hiking practice on rough, uneven ground with a loaded backpack to simulate trail conditions.
• Stair climbing to strengthen legs and knees for steep sections.

7. Is travel insurance necessary for the trek?
Yes, comprehensive travel insurance is mandatory and highly recommended. Your policy must cover medical expenses and emergency repatriation, including helicopter rescue and evacuation expenses at high altitudes (up to 6,000m). It is advisable to inform your insurance company about your trek schedule in advance.

8. What kind of accommodation and food can I expect during the trek?
Accommodation is primarily in teahouses or lodges, which are typically basic, family-run establishments. Rooms usually have two single beds with thin mattresses and pillows. Facilities become more limited and basic at higher altitudes. Heating is generally only available in communal dining areas. Toilets are often shared and may be outside the main building. We recommend bringing your own warm sleeping bag (rated -10°C to -20°C).
Meals are basic but hygienic, consisting mainly of local Nepali cuisine like dal bhat, fried rice, fried noodles, and Tibetan noodle dishes. 

9. How much cash should I carry, and are ATMs available on the route?
There are no ATMs on the trekking route. All extra purchases must be made in Nepali Rupees (NPR). We recommend carrying NPR 25,000-35,000 (approx. USD 190-270) for a 14-day trek, or USD 15-20 per day for additional expenses like hot showers, charging devices, snacks, and drinks. You should withdraw or exchange cash in Kathmandu before starting the trek.

10. When is the best time to trek the Manaslu Circuit?
The best seasons are Autumn (September-November) and Spring (March-May).
• Autumn offers stable weather, clear skies, outstanding mountain views, dry trails, and comfortable temperatures.
• Spring provides mild temperatures, longer daylight hours, clear morning views, and spectacular rhododendron and wildflower blooms. Monsoon (June-August) and Winter (December-February) treks are possible for experienced trekkers seeking solitude, but they come with significant challenges like heavy rains, landslides, leeches, or extreme cold and snow-covered passes.

11. Is altitude sickness a concern, and how can it be avoided?
Yes, altitude sickness (Acute Mountain Sickness - AMS) is a major concern as the trek involves rapid altitude gain to over 5,000m. To minimize risks, we prioritize proper acclimatization with dedicated rest days (e.g., at Samagaun and Samdo). It is crucial to trek slowly, stay well-hydrated, avoid alcohol and smoking, and report any symptoms to your guide immediately.

12. How do I get to the starting point, and what transportation is available after the trek?
The trek typically begins with an 8-10 hour drive from Kathmandu to Soti Khola or Machha Khola. The roads can be challenging, especially during the rainy season. Private vehicles can be arranged for added comfort at an extra cost.
After completing the trek, usually from Dharapani, you can take a drive back to Kathmandu via Besisahar, which takes approximately 8-10 Hour
